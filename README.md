PROJECT - Multiple choice questions and answers generation

This is my first attempt with an NLP project, it turned out to be pretty exciting, as the whole procedure as steps wasn't available at one resource only, I had to go through many literature and had to test and try every other way. Although it does not give such accurate results but it does qualifies as a basic script which serves the purpose.



Project description: The project involves web scrapping to get the data for further processing, basic NLP operations to first train on a batch to get the important sentences first and then keywords from them to generate the blanks, and distractors were generated by finding other words with least distance.
